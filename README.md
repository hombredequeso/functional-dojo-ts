Getting started with functional programming using fp-ts.


Git pull the repo.
Then, to run the exercises for map:
```
cd functional-dojo-ts
yarn
yarn test ./src/tutorial/01-map.todo.test.ts
```

Currently, see /tutorial folder.

* getting familiar with functional syntax.

01-map.test.ts
* using map over different data structures/wrappers/contexts.

01-map.todo.test.ts
* exercises to do, getting familiar with map.

01-map.answers.test.ts
* answers to 01-map.todo.test.ts
